# Weather Modelling – LAB 3

## Aim
To model and visualize weather (temperature) data using a quadratic mathematical model.

## Description
This program generates weather data using a quadratic equation and plots
temperature versus time. Random noise is added to simulate real-world
weather variations.

## Mathematical Model
y = ax² + bx + c

Where:
- x represents time  
- y represents temperature  
- a, b, c are constants  

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## File
- lab2.py

## Output
The output is a graph showing temperature variation with respect to time.

## Conclusion
The program successfully demonstrates weather modelling using a quadratic
model and visualizes the data using Python.
